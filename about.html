    <!-- Section 3: Our Purpose -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
      <p>
        We are solely dedicated to children who are marginalized and underprivileged—especially those
        living in rural villages without access to quality education. Since 2009, Life Empowerment Centre
        has offered hope, opportunity, and awareness of the right to education. These children are often
        the first generation in their families to attend school. Our goal is to help them graduate with pride
        and become breadwinners for their families.

        <h2>About Founder – Juliyes Vanathaian</h2>
        <p>
          Juliyes Vanathaian, the founder and director of Life Empowerment Trust, was born into a Dhobi family
          in Then Nerkunam, Tindivanam Taluk, Tamil Nadu. Her parents washed clothes for Dalit families, often
          receiving food as wages. As a child, Juliyes accompanied her mother at night to beg for food and helped
          wash clothes at the village pond.
        </p>
        <p>
          In school, she faced severe discrimination and humiliation from both students and teachers. The trauma
          led to debilitating migraines, forcing her to discontinue studies in 8th grade. But Juliyes never gave up.
          She learned tailoring, which restored her self-esteem. Her blouse stitching was so exceptional that even
          dominant caste families sought her work.
        </p>
        <p>
          She began teaching tailoring free of cost to young girls and conducted evening study classes for children
          of all castes. Her personal journey of resilience and compassion inspired her to launch a weekend study
          centre in 2009. Today, it serves students, youth, and families from 25 villages—offering education,
          counseling, and economic development.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Her message:</strong> "Every child deserves dignity, education, and opportunity. Together, we can build a more inclusive and compassionate world—where no one is left behind."</p>
